# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React-based interactive pathfinding algorithm visualizer that allows users to visualize different pathfinding algorithms on a 2D grid.

## Features

- **Interactive 2D Grid**: 25x50 grid where users can create walls by clicking on nodes
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports DFS (Depth-First Search), BFS (Breadth-First Search), and A* algorithms
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithms explore the grid step by step with color-coded nodes
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better development experience

## Color Coding

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Start Node
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: End Node
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Visited Nodes (shows the search process)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Path (optimal route found)
- âš« **Black**: Walls (obstacles)
- âšª **White**: Empty nodes

## Algorithms

### DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Uses a stack-based approach
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- May not find the shortest path

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Uses a queue-based approach
- Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level
- Guarantees the shortest path (in terms of number of steps)

### A* (A-Star)
- Uses heuristic-based search with Manhattan distance
- Combines the cost to reach a node with an estimate of the cost to reach the goal
- Generally finds the shortest path efficiently

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or navigate to the project directory
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `react`: ^18.2.0
- `react-dom`: ^18.2.0
- `react-scripts`: 5.0.1
- `typescript`: ^4.9.5

### Development Dependencies
- `tailwindcss`: ^3.3.6
- `postcss`: ^8.4.32
- `autoprefixer`: ^10.4.16

## Usage

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose between DFS, BFS, or A* from the control panel
2. **Create Walls**: Click on any white node to create a wall (black node)
3. **Start Visualization**: Click "Start Visualization" to see the algorithm in action
4. **Clear Options**: Use "Clear Path" to remove the current path or "Clear Grid" to reset everything
